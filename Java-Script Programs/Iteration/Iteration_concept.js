        -----------------Iteration----------------------

        CONCEPT->

         • Iteration refers to the process of repeatedly executing
           a set of statements or a block of code until a certain
           condition is met. • Loops are essential for performing repetitive tasks
           and processing collections of data, such as arrays or
]          objects.
         • It's essential for tasks like traversing arrays, processing
           collections of data, and performing repetitive
           operations.
         • JavaScript offers several loop statements for different
           iteration scenarios.

        Concept of Loops-->

        • In programming, loops are used to
          execute a block of code repeatedly
          until a certain condition is met.
        • JavaScript provides various types of
          loops, each with its own use cases and
          advantages.

          Initialization:
          • Executed once before the loop starts. It
            initializes a counter variable.
          Condition:
          • Evaluated before each iteration. If true,
            the loop continues; if false, the loopstops.
          Iteration:
          • Executed after each iteration. Typically 
          increments or decrements the counter.
